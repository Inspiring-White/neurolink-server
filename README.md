# Neurolink-server

**NeuroLink** is a project first conceived as a personal rehab exercise after suffering a brain tumor removal surgery in March 2020, and consequently _brain injury_ (also called [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury)); but also intended for helping other people who can suffer this kind of situations in the future (ABI or, in general, [neurological disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder)).
You can read about my personal experience with that process in [my blog](http://juanramirez.github.io/posts).

After having my surgery, in the process of thinking about our life **after** leaving the hospital, we (my wife and me) found that there _were_ resources for rehabilitation and people who could help us, but there wasn't any _easy way to find_ them and connect.

**NeuroLink** aims to fill that gap connecting all these kind of people:
* People who experience at first-hand these kind of damage (we will call them **patients** from now on).
* People who care for them (**carers**), usually (but not always) their relatives.
* Neurology or neurological rehabilitation professionals (**professionals**).


# Concept

NeuroLink aims to be a _social network_ for people directly or indirectly affected by [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury) or [neurological disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder).

## Tech stack and code organization

The project is conceived as a client-server project, mainly in Javascript. The server is REST and being built on top of [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).
