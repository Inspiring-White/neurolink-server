# Neurolink

**NeuroLink** is a project first conceived as a personal rehab exercise after suffering a brain tumor removal surgery in March 2020, and consequently _brain injury_ (also called [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury)); but also intended for helping people who can suffer this kind of situations in the future (ABI or, in general, neurological damage).

After having the surgery, in the process of thinking about our life **after** leaving the hospital, we (my wife and me) found that there _were_ resources for rehabilitation and people who could help us, but there wasn't any _easy way to find_ them and connect.

**NeuroLink** aims to fill that gap conecting all these kind of people:
* People who suffer these kind of damage (we will call them **patients** from now on).
* People who care for them (**carers**).
* Professionals of neurology or neurological rehabilitation (**professionals**).


# Concept

NeuroLink aims to be a _social network_ for people affected or related with ABI.
